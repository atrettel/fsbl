Falkner-Skan boundary layer solvers in multiple programming languages.

I want to use this project to write the same program in multiple languages.
The point is so that I can evaluate how the different languages represent the
program, especially in regards to how they handle different numerical issues
like arrays and floating point numbers.


## Usage

The Python version is the prototype (reference implementation) for the other
versions of the program.

    $ python3 fsbl.py [beta] [f0] [n] [eta_max] [h0_min] [h0_max]

All command line arguments are OPTIONAL.  The default values are

- `beta = 0.0` (Falkner-Skan pressure gradient parameter)

- `f0 = 0.0` (boundary condition on `f`)

- `n = 16384` (number of grid points)

- `eta_max = 10.0` (maximum coordinate value)

- `h0_min = 0.0` (minimum `h0` value for bisection search)

- `h0_max = 0.0` (maximum `h0` value for bisection search)

When `h0_min == h0_max`, the program uses an algorithm to find the bisection
search interval.  This algorithm works well for `-0.198837 < beta < +1.25`.
Outside of this range all command line arguments must be specified to get a
meaningful solution.  For example, for the case of `beta = 2.0`, the following
parameters work:

    $ python3 fsbl.py 2.0 0.0 16384 10.0 1.67 1.69

Note that the program has difficulty calculating the profile as it approaches
separation at `beta = -0.19884`.  It can get rather close (`beta = -0.198837`)
but not all the way there as it is written right now.  It should be possible to
correct this issue but I at least wanted to note it for the time being.


## TODO list

- Code ported to several languages, including C, C++, Fortran, Java, Julia, ...

- Detailed documentation on the mathematics behind the Falkner-Skan profiles.

- Verification and validation and uncertainty quantification.
