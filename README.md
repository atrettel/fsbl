Falkner-Skan boundary layer solvers in multiple programming languages.

I want to use this project to write the same program in multiple languages.
The point is so that I can evaluate how the different languages represent the
program, especially in regards to how they handle different numerical issues
like arrays and floating point numbers.


## Usage

    $ python3 fsbl.py [BETA] [F0] [N] [ETA_MAX] [H0_MIN] [H0_MAX]

All command line arguments are OPTIONAL.  The default values are

- `beta = 0.0` (Falkner-Skan pressure gradient parameter)

- `f0 = 0.0` (boundary condition on `f`)

- `n = 16384` (number of grid points)

- `eta_max = 10.0` (maximum coordinate value)

- `h0_min = 0.0` (minimum `h0` value for bisection search)

- `h0_max = 1.0` (maximum `h0` value for bisection search)

For most cases far away from `beta = 0.0`, all command line arguments must be
specified to get a meaningful solution.


## TODO list

- Code ported to several languages, including C, C++, Fortran, Java, Julia, ...

- Detailed documentation on the mathematics behind the Falkner-Skan profiles.

- Verification and validation.
