Data for validation and benchmarking
====================================


## Benchmarks

These benchmarks are previous high-quality calculations of the Falkner-Skan or
Blasius boundary layers.  Benchmarking is not strictly speaking the same thing
as either verification or validation, since it neither establishes the the
implementation's correctness nor compares the program's results to the real
world.  Nonetheless, benchmarking does compare the program's results to some
previous standard, and that provides some information about how well the
program meets expectations.

    - Notes

        - This benchmark uses different boundary conditions than the code, so
          the results must be re-scaled for a proper comparison.

            - `eta = eta_Emmons * sqrt(2.0)`

            - `f = f_Emmons / sqrt(2.0)`

            - `f' = g = f'_Emmons / 2.0`

            - `f'' = h = 0.5 * f''_Emmons / sqrt(2.0)`
